### **1. Compounding Revenue Growth with Quarterly Adjustments**

```python
def revenue_growth_with_adjustments(initial_revenue, annual_growth_rate, quarterly_adjustments, periods):
    """
    Simulates compounding revenue growth with quarterly adjustments.
    """
    revenue = [initial_revenue]
    for i in range(1, periods + 1):
        next_revenue = revenue[-1] * (1 + annual_growth_rate / 4) + quarterly_adjustments[i % len(quarterly_adjustments)]
        revenue.append(next_revenue)
    return revenue

# Example: Initial revenue = $1M, growth rate = 8% annually, adjustments for each quarter
adjustments = [20000, 15000, -10000, 5000]
revenue = revenue_growth_with_adjustments(1_000_000, 0.08, adjustments, 12)
print("Quarterly Revenue Growth:", revenue)
```

### **2. Profit Margin Optimization with Seasonal Cost Variations**

```python
def profit_margin_optimization(revenue, fixed_costs, seasonal_costs):
    """
    Calculates profit margins considering seasonal variations in costs.
    """
    profit_margin = []
    for i in range(len(revenue)):
        costs = fixed_costs + seasonal_costs[i % len(seasonal_costs)]
        profit_margin.append((revenue[i] - costs) / revenue[i])
    return profit_margin

# Example: Revenue and costs for 8 months
revenue = [100000, 120000, 110000, 115000, 130000, 125000, 135000, 140000]
seasonal_costs = [20000, 25000, 30000, 15000]

### **3. Expense Forecast with Inflation Adjustment**

```python

    """
    Projects business expenses with inflation adjustments over time.
    """

    return expenses

# Example: Base expense = $500,000, inflation rate = 3%, periods = 5 years
expenses = expense_forecast(500_000, 0.03, 5)
print("Projected Expenses:", expenses)
```

### **4. Dynamic Pricing Strategy Using Demand Elasticity**

```python
def dynamic_pricing(base_price, elasticity, demand_changes):
    """
    Adjusts prices dynamically based on demand elasticity.
    """
    prices = [base_price]
    for change in demand_changes:
        new_price = prices[-1] * (1 + elasticity * change)
        prices.append(new_price)
    return prices

# Example: Base price = $100, elasticity = -0.2, demand changes over 6 periods
demand_changes = [0.05, -0.1, 0.08, -0.05, 0.03, -0.02]
pricing = dynamic_pricing(100, -0.2, demand_changes)
print("Dynamic Prices:", pricing)
```

### **5. Product Portfolio Profitability Analysis**

```python
def profitability_analysis(products, costs, revenues):
    """

    """
    margins = {product: (revenues[product] - costs[product]) / revenues[product] 
               for product in products}
    return margins

# Example: Product portfolio with costs and revenues
products = ['A', 'B', 'C']
costs = {'A': 50000, 'B': 70000, 'C': 45000}
revenues = {'A': 100000, 'B': 120000, 'C': 90000}

### **6. Capital Allocation to High-Growth Opportunities**

```python
def allocate_capital(total_budget, projects):

    """
    sorted_projects = sorted(projects.items(), key=lambda x: -x[1])
    allocation = {}
    for project, roi in sorted_projects:
        allocation[project] = min(total_budget, projects[project])
        total_budget -= allocation[project]
        if total_budget <= 0:
            break
    return allocation

# Example: Budget = $1M, projects with expected ROI
projects = {'Project X': 300000, 'Project Y': 500000, 'Project Z': 800000}
allocation = allocate_capital(1_000_000, projects)

```python
def customer_lifetime_value(avg_purchase_value, purchase_frequency, retention_rate, discount_rate):
    """
    Computes the CLV using a simplified formula.
    """
    clv = avg_purchase_value * purchase_frequency * (retention_rate / (1 + discount_rate - retention_rate))
    return clv

# Example: Average purchase = $200, frequency = 5/year, retention = 80%, discount = 10%
clv = customer_lifetime_value(200, 5, 0.8, 0.1)
print("Customer Lifetime Value:", clv)
```

### **8. Inventory Management with Safety Stock Levels**

```python
def safety_stock(mean_demand, std_dev, service_level_z):
    """
    Calculates safety stock levels for inventory management.
    """
    safety_stock = service_level_z * std_dev
    return mean_demand + safety_stock

# Example: Mean demand = 1000 units, std dev = 200 units, service level Z = 1.65
stock = safety_stock(1000, 200, 1.65)
print("Safety Stock Level:", stock)

def npv(cash_flows, discount_rate):
    """

    """
    return sum(cash_flow / ((1 + discount_rate) ** year) for year, cash_flow in enumerate(cash_flows))

# Example: Cash flows over 5 years and a discount rate of 10%
cash_flows = [-500000, 150000, 200000, 250000, 300000]
npv_value = npv(cash_flows, 0.1)

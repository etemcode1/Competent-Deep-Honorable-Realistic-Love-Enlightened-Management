Most of the traits (courtship, bird and frog songs) are under multigenic control and they depend to a large extent on the influence of the environment. In a few cases large effects of single genes have also been observed (Hall JC 2002 J Neurogenet 16:135). In Drosophila the fruitless (fru) gene is involved in the determination of courtship. The FruM transcription factor protein is expressed in about 2% of the neurons of the central nervous system. When the yeast GAL4 gene is inserted into the fru locus FruM is expressed in all the peripheral sensory systems involved in courtship. Gal4 is a positive regulatory protein of the yeast galactose gene. Inhibition of FruM in the olfactory system components reduces olfaction‐dependent courtship. Transient inactivation of all FruM‐expressing neurons terminates courtship behavior without affecting other behavioral traits.
